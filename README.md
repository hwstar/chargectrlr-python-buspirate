**Introduction**

This is a simple python/tkinter utility for viewing variables on my 6volt-5W-solar-cc project using a Bus Pirate and 
connected to the i2c interface on the Arduino. This utility retrieves key charge controller variables and updates the 
status window 5 times per second.

In addition to showing charge controller variables, it also allows the charge controller to be calibrated using
a stable 6V voltage source.


This program has been tested on Linux. No testing has been done for Windows.
